## 🌟 Vision

The **Virtual AI Manager (VAM)** is an autonomous managerial system designed to operate continuously alongside human teams. Unlike requested-response chatbots, VAM proactively plans, monitors, and executes management tasks—scheduling meetings, approving leave, tracking deadlines, and reporting progress—while keeping humans in the loop via a dedicated control plane.

## 🏗 System Architecture

VAM operates on a multi-agent architecture using **LangGraph** for orchestration and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for tool integration.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Autonomous Planning**: Decomposes high-level goals (e.g., "Launch Marketing Campaign") into actionable steps and dependency graphs.
- **🤝 People Operations**: Handles leave requests with approval rationale, detects burnout risks, and manages skills/meetings.
- **📈 Growth & Scaling**: Manages hiring pipelines, generates 30-60-90 day onboarding plans, and curates internal knowledge bases.
- **👁️ Active Monitoring**: Continuously watches task statuses and proactively flags risks before deadlines are missed.
- **📊 Analytics & Automation**: Data-driven insights, risk forecasting, executive dashboards, and proactive suggestions.
- **� Managerial Intelligence**: Provides strategic risk analysis, goal refinement, and automates standups/reporting.
- **�🛡️ Human Control Plane**: A "God Mode" dashboard to observe agent thought processes in real-time and intervene/override actions instantly.
- **🔌 Deep Integration**: Built on MCP to plug into Google Calendar, Slack, GitHub, and Jira without custom glue code.
