# 🤖 VAM Agent System Documentation

This document connects the functional specifications to the codebase, explaining how the multi-agent system thinks, routes, and executes.

---

## 🧠 The Orchestrator (`backend/app/agents/orchestrator.py`)

The **Manager Orchestrator** is the root node of the LangGraph system. It acts as the "Prefrontal Cortex" of VAM.

- **Responsibility**: Interprets incoming intent from the user or environment signals and routes control to the specialized agent best suited to handle it.
- **Routing Logic**:
  - `intent: planning` -> **Planning Agent**
  - `intent: personnel/leave` -> **People Ops Agent**
  - `intent: hiring/growth` -> **Growth & Scaling Agent**
  - `intent: analytics/forecast` -> **Analytics & Automation Agent**
  - `intent: platform/security` -> **Platform & Enterprise Agent**
  - `intent: status/check` -> **Execution Agent**
  - `intent: notify` -> **Communication Agent**
  - `intent: strategy/risk` -> **Managerial Agent**
  - `intent: advanced/custom` -> **Advanced Capabilities Agent**
